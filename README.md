# Description
It has been two weeks since Sonic's disappearance. Tails has narrowed Sonic's location down to an undisclosed base at the edge of Green Hill. But there's more to said base than meets the eye, especially considering what's happened to his best friend. Can Tails survive...

EGGMAN'S SECRET BASE.

Eggman's Secret Base Recoded is a fangame remake of the same name. Play as Tails and escape the base once again in this new recoded version of the original game! Find items to fix the mobile, don't get caught, and make sure you are quiet in order to progress.

Original game by Latiamon.
